  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
      <li>
        <h4><span>Notice how you feel</span></h4>
        <p>Notice how you feel, and why. If you feel like crying - go ahead and do it. Sad music or movies can help to let the emotions out. You might feel a lot better after.</p>
      </li>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
      <li>
        <h4><span>Listen to music</span></h4>
        <p>What type of music do you feel like listening to right now? Whether happy or sad music - it is a healthy outlet to express your emotions. And if you want to sing or dance - even better, groove it out!</p>
      </li>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
      <li>
        <h4><span>Do some exercise</span></h4>
        <p>Did you know that exercise floods your body with endorphines - the happyness hormone? Even if you don't feel like it right now - try some excercise like running, doing, yoga, dancing, jumping. <p>
      </li>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
      <li>
        <h4><span>Take a shower and get dressed</span></h4>
        <p>Even if you're not going anywhere! Putting on your favourite clothes and dressing up can help you cheer yourself up. You are beautiful.</p>
      </li>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
      <li>
       <h4><span>Take some time for yourself.</span></h4>
       <p>It doesn't matter what, as long as you enjoy doing it: a face mask, a nice cup of tea or a nap. Treat yourself to something that makes you feel good.</p>

      <li>
        <h4><span>Smile</span></h4>
        <p>Yes, even if you don't feel like it. Researchers have found out that using these muscles in your face send signals to your brain, which release dopamin and serotonin - perfect recipe for feeling better!</p>
      </li>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
      <li>
        <h4><span>Go out into nature</span></h4>
        <p>Even if it's just for a walk in the park. The fresh air, the animals and birds around you are a reminder that everything and everyone goes through phases and cycles - it's the circle of life!
