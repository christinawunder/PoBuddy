Well, I can feel that you are angry today.
Here you can find some advices to deal with your anger :

blow some steam with physical exercise ! (go for a run or, if you hate exercise, just put the music very loud and dance your heart out)

take a time out. (it’s the occasion to reconnect with yourself, maybe with a little bit of meditation)

Take deep breaths. When you are angry, you become physiologically aroused (your heart rate is increases, your muscles tense up, etc.). Respond by taking long, slow, deep breaths, using the diaphragm rather than the just the chest. Deep breathing is one of the best ways to relax when in a tense moment.

identify possible solutions. (instead of focusing on what made yu mad, work on resolving the issue at hand)

sleep (a lake of rest influe on your nerves. Being tired makes negative experiences feel worse than they would otherwise. Turn off your phone, lie down and take a nap !)



It’s ok to get mad sometimes. (When you are angry, you become physiologically aroused (your heart rate is increases, your muscles tense up, etc.). Respond by taking long, slow, deep breaths, using the diaphragm rather than the just the chest. Deep breathing is one of the best ways to relax when in a tense moment.)
